# URGENT: Netlify Deployment Fix Required

## Current Problem
The deployment is still calling the `/restore` endpoint and getting 422 errors, even though we thought we removed it. The browser cache might not be refreshed, or there's another version of the code running.

## Immediate Solution Required

You need to **manually edit** the `waitForDeployment` function in `src/services/netlify.ts` around line 605.

### Find this section (around lines 627-640):
```typescript
        if (consecutiveNewStates >= 6) {
          console.warn(`⚠️ Deployment has been in "new" state for ${consecutiveNewStates * 5} seconds`);
          
          // After 30 seconds in "new" state, check if this might be a successful static deployment
          if (consecutiveNewStates >= 6) {
            console.log('� Deployment appears to be static content - checking if it\'s actually ready');
            
            // For deployments with no file uploads, "new" state might be the final state
            // Let's check the deploy URL to see if the site is actually accessible
            const deployUrl = deployment.deploy_url || deployment.deploy_ssl_url;
            if (deployUrl) {
              console.log(`✅ Static deployment completed - site available at: ${deployUrl}`);
              return; // Exit successfully for static deployments
            }
          }
```

### Replace it with this:
```typescript
        if (consecutiveNewStates >= 6) {
          console.log('🔄 Deployment in "new" state for 30+ seconds - likely static content');
          
          const deployUrl = deployment.deploy_url || deployment.deploy_ssl_url;
          if (deployUrl) {
            console.log(`✅ Static deployment ready - site available at: ${deployUrl}`);
            return; // Exit successfully
          }
        }
```

## Key Changes:
1. **Remove duplicate condition**: The nested `if (consecutiveNewStates >= 6)` was redundant
2. **Simplify logic**: Check deploy URL immediately when 30 seconds elapsed
3. **Fix Unicode**: Remove the corrupted character (�) in the console.log

## After Making Changes:
1. **Save the file**
2. **Hard refresh the browser** (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
3. **Try deployment again**

## Expected Result:
- No more `/restore` endpoint calls
- Deployment completes in 30 seconds for static content
- Console shows: "Static deployment ready - site available at: [URL]"

## If You Still See 422 Errors:
This means there's cached code or another location calling `/restore`. Search the entire file for:
- `restore`
- `unlock` 
- `lock`
- `cancel`

And remove any such calls from the `waitForDeployment` function.

## Browser Cache Issue:
The 422 error suggests the browser is running old cached JavaScript. After editing:
1. Close all browser tabs
2. Restart development server (npm run dev)
3. Hard refresh browser
4. Clear browser cache if needed

The deployment should complete successfully without any 422 errors.
